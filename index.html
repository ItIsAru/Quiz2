          <h3 class="subtitle">AUTOBIOGRAPHY </h3>
          <p class=text>My name is Doggo Penis in Perevuian. 
          I am a Bachelor of Science in Entertainment and Multimedia computing at *insert doggo university. 
          I was born in Davao city and have been living since the 11th day of December in the year, 2000. My mother is [redacted]. 
          She was born in [redacted] On the other hand, my father,[redacted], born at Davao City.</p>
          <p class=text>I am very introverted with a passion of creative media. 
          I tend to lean on encapsulating my emotions and experience through different media of art since 
          it is a best way to further recognize certain emotions and actualization on a certain event. 
          I am not best person in terms of emotional management and that is why I rely on these hobbies of mine to organize them.</p>
          <p class=text>I am studying Japanese. I started when I was in high school since my school offers a class for it. 
          After 2 years, I took the Japanese Language Proficiency Test at the first level (N5) and passed it. 
          Currently, JLPT is still not available, but I am hoping for them to be available so I can continue my language ventures. </p>
          <p class=text>I am pretty altruistic. I tend to help people in need without thinking of myself. 
          It can be a blessing yet a curse depending on the situation. 
          I am mostly willing to assist them if ever I am know the certain field such a Math, Research, Art, and etc. 
          I always forget to say "No" whenever I am in a tight schedule. I am trying my best to prioritize myself lately. 
          It is a constant struggle, but I hope I can overcome it.</p>
          <p class=text>Currently, I am studying both programming and animation since it is my passion and 
          I wanted to be a part of the gaming/animation industry soon. 
          I am eager to learn, but I can be emotionally occupied sometimes and it is my current handicap. 
          I am desperate to be bolder and stronger each day, and hopefully I can be the person that I kept on dreaming someday.</p>

          <img class="aru-picture" src="aru2.jpg">
          <p class=text>I envisioned myself to be jubilant and emotionally stable with my job. 
          I would be in the art/music department of a studio, trying to release a project or two. 
          I am also doing some part-time commissions as a side job for my personal ventures as well. 
          I will have a dog as my companion while living alone in peace and I will name it "Nougat". 
          I am planning to expand my ventures such as getting a masters degree, trying to be in an education institution, 
          or even streaming for fun.</p>
